# PersonalSite-GoReact
 
This is a first attempt to create a Go backend with a React front end, that I can then use for my personal site

# TODOs
-  Prepopulate DB
-  Pull DB info into backend
-  Use some sort of ORM to pull info (hoping to give graphql a try)
-  Maaaayybbbeeee set up some sort of caching mechanism (would be worthwhile to give redis a crack)
-  Then I need to shove all of this onto a container(docker) initialization script where I can just build it at will
-  Host it somewhere and point my hostname at it
